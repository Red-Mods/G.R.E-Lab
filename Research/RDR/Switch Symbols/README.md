# What is the 'main' file ?
This file contains the Nintendo Switch symbols, it can be used to reverse engineer stuff related to Red Dead Redemption. This can be finally used and ported to PC version of the game.

# How to use ?
It's recommended to use [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_11.0.3_build) or [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) bcs **IDA** seems to not work well. You can install [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_11.0.3_build) and use a [plugin](https://github.com/Adubbz/Ghidra-Switch-Loader/releases) capable of loading Nintendo Switch symbols

> [!NOTE]
> Switch symbols database for IDA 7.7 is still provided, but like previously said, this is not really recommended since a lot of variables name will be invalid and lead to nothing.
