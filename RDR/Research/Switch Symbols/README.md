# What is the 'main' file ?
This is the Nintendo Switch symbols, it can be used to reverse engineer stuff related to Red Dead Redemption.

# How to use ?
It's recommended to use [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_11.0.3_build) or [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) bcs **IDA** seems to not work well. You can install [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_11.0.3_build) and use a [plugin](https://github.com/Adubbz/Ghidra-Switch-Loader/releases) capable of loading Nintendo Switch symbols
